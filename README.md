This is basically just a template to change d2tmo to d2att. everything works. these phones are nearly interoperable.

this was done so that all that's truely needed is to keep d2tmo updated.

kernel and modules should build if your on linux (sadly,  im not - so they are included here, but can be removed)

im lazy.

credits go to designgears for testing this shiz on his phone.
